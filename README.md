# RFID_door_lock

This GitHub repository presents a project focused on implementing a door lock system using Radio-Frequency Identification (RFID) technology.

### Project Overview

This project aims to enhance security by allowing access through authorized RFID cards or tags. The system utilizes an RFID reader to scan tags and control a locking mechanism accordingly.

* **Hardware Components**:

  * Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller
  * RFID reader module (e.g., RC522)
  * Relay module to control the lock
  * Solenoid lock or electronic strike
  * Power supply

* **Software Components**:

  * Arduino code to read RFID tags and control the lock
  * Libraries such as `MFRC522` for RFID communication
